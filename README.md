# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Tailwind CSS gradients where they might not render as expected due to CSS conflicts or incorrect configuration.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a potential solution.

## Problem

Tailwind's gradient utilities can be affected by conflicting CSS rules or an improperly configured Tailwind setup. This can result in gradients not appearing, rendering incorrectly, or failing to apply the desired effects. 

## Solution

The solution often involves carefully reviewing the CSS for conflicts, checking the Tailwind configuration for errors (particularly concerning the `important` flag), and ensuring that no other CSS rules are overriding the Tailwind gradient styles.  Consider using more specific selectors and the `!important` flag cautiously, only as a last resort.
